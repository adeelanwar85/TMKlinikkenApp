# Loyalty & Auth Overhaul Walkthrough

## Overview
This task focused on ensuring the reliability of the Loyalty Program and Authentication system. We addressed critical issues with the Hano API (Email Search failure) by reverting to a robust Mobile/SMS flow and built deep integration for fetching historical loyalty data.

## Key Changes

### 1. Authentication Strategy (Mobile First)
*   **Problem**: Hano API's `/customer/search` endpoint for Email is unreliable/broken (returns 400 or empty).
*   **Solution**: Reverted the Login flow to prioritize **Mobile Number** (SMS).
*   **Verification**: Verified `GetCustomerByMobile` works reliably for customer `98697419` (Adeel), ensuring users can log in and retrieve their ID.

### 2. Loyalty Debug Panel
*   **Feature**: Added a hidden Admin screen (`/admin/loyalty-debug`) to inspect Hano data live.
*   **Capabilities**:
    *   **Customer Probe**: Lookup by Mobile or ID to see Bonus Points and Product History.
    *   **Transaction Verification**: Check `Paid` status of specific appointments.
*   **Fix**: Replaced `Alert.prompt` with `TextInput` to prevent crashes on Web.

### 3. Deep Loyalty Integration
*   **Feature**: Profile Screen (`app/(tabs)/profile.tsx`) now triggers a **Full History Sync** on load.
*   **Logic**:
    *   Fetches 12 months of history from Hano.
    *   Calculates Stamps (Treatments > 1500kr) and Points (Products 10%).
    *   Syncs Hano Native Bonus Points (if non-zero) to the local wallet.
*   **Critical Fix**: Discovered Hano History API returns a **Paginated Object** (`{ Items: [...] }`) instead of an array. Updated `HanoService.ts` to correctly parse this, preventing "No History" errors.

## Verification Results

### Login & Data Access
> [!SUCCESS]
> **Mobile Lookup**: Confirmed working. Found Customer ID `642`.
> **History Access**: Confirmed working. Retreived 25+ past activities (including paid transactions).

### Loyalty Calculation
> [!SUCCESS]
> **Points Logic**: `debug_simulate_sync_logic.js` confirmed the app can iterate through the Hano history stream.
> **Service Fix**: `HanoService.ts` was patched to handle the `{ Items: [...] }` response structure, ensuring data is not ignored.

## Next Steps
*   **User Testing**: Log in with real credentials on the physical device to see the "Glød" status update live.
*   **Refinement**: Monitor the "Full Sync" performance on Profile load; consider caching if it becomes too slow.
